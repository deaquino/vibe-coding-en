# Security Policy

We take the security of the `vibe-coding-cn` project very seriously. This document outlines how to report security vulnerabilities to us and how we will handle them.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We kindly request that you report any potential security vulnerabilities to us via email rather than disclosing them in the public issue tracker. This gives us the opportunity to fix the vulnerability before it can be publicly exploited.

Please send details to: tukuai.ai@gmail.com

Please include the following information in your report:
*   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Affected versions.
*   If possible, provide a proof of concept (PoC) or exploit code.

## Our Commitment

Once we receive your security report, we will:
*   Confirm receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.
*   Investigate the vulnerability and determine its impact.
*   Work with you to resolve the vulnerability.
*   Notify you once the fix is complete.
*   Publicly acknowledge your contribution at an appropriate time (if you agree).

We are committed to resolving all reported security issues as quickly as possible and appreciate your help in keeping the `vibe-coding-cn` project secure.
